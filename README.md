Tennis-Club-Booking-System
==========================

The Tennis Club Booking System is a tool designed to help administrate and manage tennis club data, including bookings and members. The system allows you to add, edit and delete both bookings and members. It offers both a list view and a calendar view for viewing bookings stored in the system, and a list view for viewing members. The system checks input when adding data to the system so that any bookings/members added follow the club’s schedule/rules. When viewing bookings/members to user can filter to list to specified parameters allowing easy searching of the system. The system also creates automated backups of the database every week to keep the database safe, and also requiring an admin login to view members’ personal details.
